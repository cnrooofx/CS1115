            <h1>Heroes</h1>
            <p>
                These stories are set <em>much</em> later than those of the gods and are like a bridge between the mythological realms of the gods and the real world. Probably the most famous of these are from <i>Homer&rsquo;s</i> epic poems, the <b>Odyssey</b> and the <b>Iliad</b>.
            </p>

                <h1>Heracles</h1>
                <p>
                    Heracles, more commonly known by his roman name Hercules, was the son of <i>Zeus</i> and the human <i>Alcmene</i>. Being an iligitimate son of Zeus, <i>Hera</i> always had an  hatred of <i>Heracles</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His divine parentage made <i>Heracles</i> a <b>demigod</b> and he inherited imense strength from his father. Out of jealousy, <i>Hera</i> sent two venomous snakes to kill him and his twin brother <i>Iphicles</i> in their crib. Unfortunately for <i>Hera</i>, her plan didn&rsquo;t work and <i>Heracles</i> began to play with the snakes and strangled them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not satisfied, <i>Hera</i> cast a curse on <i>Heracles</i> that drove him mad and caused him to kill his wife and children. Unsure of what to do he visited the <i>Oracle of Delphi</i> for advice. <i>Hera</i> had interfered with the Oracle and she directed <i>Heracles</i> to serve <i>King Eurystheus</i>, his archenemy, for ten long years and to undertake any task that was asked of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over ten years, <i>King Eurystheus</i> ordered Heracles to perform all manner of seemingly impossible tasks, all of which he suceeded in. He killed a lion with his bare hands; he had to retrieve <b>the girdle of Hippolyta</b>, <i>Queen of the Amazons</i>; he stole a <b>golden apple of the <i>Hesperides</i></b> and finally he descended into the underworld and brought <i>Cerberus</i>, the three-headed dog who guarded the gates, back to the King.

                    Prometheus, who was still chained up to his rock, was freed by <i>Heracles</i> who shot down the eagle

                <h1>Jason & The Argonauts - The Odyssey</h1>
                <p>
                    Jason was the true heir to the throne of <i>Thessaly</i> but <i>Pelias</i>, who had usurped the throne from Jason&rsquo;s father, demanded that he retrieve the Golden Fleece in order to become King.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He assembled a crew of legendary heroes to sail aboard the <i>Argo</i>. They became known as the <i>Argonauts</i> after the ship.
