                <h1>Gaia&rsquo;s Revenge</h1>

                <p>
                    <i>Gaia</i> loved the <i lang="el">Hecatoncheires</i> but when <i>Ouranos</i> saw them with their hundred hands and fifty heads he was disgusted at how monstrous they were. They were the most powerful beings yet and <i>Ouranos</i> feared that they would grow up and threaten his supreme rule thus he cast them to the depths of Tartarus. Gaia was furious and asked all of her children in turn to help her get revenge. All refused to help her, all except for <i>Kronos</i>, the youngest and most fearless of the Titans.
