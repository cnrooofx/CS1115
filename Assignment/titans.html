                <h1>Gaia&rsquo;s Revenge</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>Gaia</i> loved the <i lang="el">Hecatoncheires</i> but when <i>Ouranos</i> saw them with their hundred hands and fifty heads he was disgusted at how monstrous they were. They were the most powerful beings yet and <i>Ouranos</i> feared that they would grow up and threaten his supreme rule thus he cast them to the depths of Tartarus. Gaia was <em>furious</em> and urged all of her children in turn to help her get revenge. All refused to help her, all except for <i>Kronos</i>, the youngest and most fearless of the Titans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Kronos</i> laid in wait with a giant sickle created for him by <i>Gaia</i>. Later that night when <i>Ouranos</i> came to copulate with <i>Gaia</i>, he castrated his father and cast his genitals into the ocean. When they came into contact with the ocean, the water began to froth and foam and the <b>Goddess of Beauty</b>, <i>Aphrodite</i>, emerged. With <i>Ouranos</i> now powerless, <i>Kronos</i> and his sister <i>Rhea</i> took over from their father king and queen of the world. The Titans, were now the most powerful beings in the cosmos.
