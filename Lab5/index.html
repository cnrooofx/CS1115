                        This is Cocky-the-Rooster. We cured him of his aviophobia by electrifying this fence.

                    Many chickens have a <b>fear of flying</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, it's not so much a fear of flying. It's just that they're not very 
                    good at it. A combination of evolution and selective breeding has left the 
                    average chicken with too much breast and not enough wing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is unfortunate for chickens but good for us&hellip;

                    Does your hen keep <b>scratching</b> the ground, <b>pecking</b> and <b>clucking</b>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes? Well, this is normal. Stop worrying. It's what hens do.

                    An amazing 26% of all chickens are <b>addicted</b> to nicotine. As soon as the 
                    farmer's back is turned, they light up and puff away contentedly.
