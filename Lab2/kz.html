                            Justin, who runs our Wednesday evening classes, is thinking of holding a <b>wine tasting</b>.

Let us know if you’d be interested in attending.

                            Mrs Barb Dwyer of Ballincollig wrote to tell us of a fun <b>event</b>. She and her friends planned a week of dinners at each others’ houses – a kind of do-it-yourself version of the TV series <i>Come Dine With Me</i>. What a great idea! Unfortunately, the dinners were abandoned mid-week when all four friends contracted <i>Salmonella enterocolitis</i> from undercooked quail eggs

                <h1>This Month’s Recipe: Vegetarian Stew</h1>
                <p>
                    This month’s recipe has been sent in by Colonel Ray Ling from Clonmel. He writes: “This was a great favourite among the boys of my command when we were stationed in the foothills of the Transdanubian Mountains in Hungary. The locals refer to it as <i lang="de">p&ouml;rk&ouml;lt</i>, but we just called it stew. It’s deliciously warming and only 500 calories.” It sounds great, Ray! Ye all let us know how you get on with it.
